              A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
              Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
              experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
              diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
              content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
              strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes
              daily for five days a week.
